## üß© How It Works

StarMedic is built around an interactive gameplay loop where players diagnose and treat patients from various species in the Star Wars universe. The game is structured as follows:

1. **Random Patient Selection**: A patient with a randomly generated disease and symptoms is selected from the database.
  
2. **Dialogue and Decision-Making**: 
   - The Situation LLM creates the context and sets the scene by reviewing patient information.
   - The Actor LLM takes the role of a character within the game, engaging the player in dialogue.
   - Players can ask questions, suggest tests, or directly make a diagnosis by selecting from multiple options.
  
3. **Processing and Feedback**:
   - The Disease Reasoning LLM interprets the player's inputs, checks if they correspond to symptoms, and offers clarifications or test results.
   - If the player selects a correct diagnosis, the game proceeds to provide positive feedback; if incorrect, hints are given to guide them toward the right diagnosis.
   - The Options LLM dynamically generates and presents new choices based on the context of the game.

4. **Game Continuation**:
   - Players continue making decisions and engaging in dialogues until they correctly diagnose the patient's condition or the game ends.
  
5. **Scoring**:
   - Points are awarded based on the accuracy and efficiency of the player's decisions, encouraging them to hone their diagnostic skills.
